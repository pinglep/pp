This profile is a compliation of all the the assignments and projects I have done during the course of my Masters of Science in Information Systems.
The assignments involve assignment problem-set and project application in Core-Java.
It also contains my current mobile development course projects in iOS, Swift.

My profile is a fair reflection of how far I have come in the field of application development and my knowledge in Informnation Systems.
I hope you enjoy reading through it!
